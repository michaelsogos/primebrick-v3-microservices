# Devin Rule: Data Model Conventions

## Trigger
- Applies to ALL code in this repository that defines, reads, or returns data models: entities, DALs, services, routers, DTOs, JSON API responses, TS types.

## Golden Rules

### 1. Snake_case everywhere — maximum portability
- DB columns, TS interfaces/types, JSON request bodies, JSON response bodies — ALL use `snake_case`.
- A field named `oidc_issuer_url` in the DB must be `oidc_issuer_url` in the TS interface, `oidc_issuer_url` in the JSON response, and `oidc_issuer_url` in any consumer.
- NEVER rename `oidc_issuer_url` → `oidcIssuerUrl` (camelCase) between layers. The name is identical from DB to JSON response.
- **Exception:** External API adapters (e.g. a third-party service that expects camelCase). The camelCase is dictated by the external API, not by our convention. The translation happens ONLY at the adapter boundary, never in our internal data flow.

### 2. No DTO transformation between DB models and TS models
- If the DB returns `{ oidc_issuer_url, casdoor_endpoint, auth_mode }`, the TS interface is `{ oidc_issuer_url, casdoor_endpoint, auth_mode }` — NOT a rebuilt object with renamed fields.
- Do NOT create intermediate DTO classes/interfaces that rename fields between the DB row and the internal TS model. The DB row IS the TS model.
- Prefer spreading the raw result (`return { ...settings, <overrides> }`) over field-by-field rebuilding (`return { fieldA: row.field_a, fieldB: row.field_b, ... }`).

### 3. No transformation unless it's a real TYPE conversion
- ALLOWED: `string` (DB) → `boolean` (TS) via `=== "true"`. This is a type conversion, not data-quality enforcement.
- ALLOWED: `string` (DB) → `enum` (TS) via validation + normalization (e.g. uppercase for enum comparison). This is type safety, not data-quality enforcement.
- FORBIDDEN: Lowercasing, uppercasing, trimming, or any data-quality normalization on the READ path. Data quality is enforced at the WRITE path (API upsert validation). The read path returns exactly what the DB has.
- FORBIDDEN: Fallback defaults on the read path (e.g. `|| "http://localhost:8000"`, `?? ""`). A value either exists in the DB or it doesn't — `undefined` if missing, `null` if the row exists but value is NULL, `string` if present. Mandatory-field checks throw before the return, they don't fake a default.

### 4. JSON API responses: snake_case for entity-shaped responses
- If a JSON response represents an entity or an array of entities, the field names MUST be `snake_case` — matching the DB column names and the TS entity interface.
- Example: `res.json({ available, email, existing_uuid })` — correct. `res.json({ available, email, existingUuid })` — WRONG.
- Do NOT create a DTO layer in the router that renames entity fields to camelCase before `res.json()`. If the entity is already snake_case, pass it through directly.
- If the response is a computed shape (not an entity), field names are still snake_case for consistency.

### 5. No fake defaults for configuration data
- AUTH CONFIG, IDP config, gateway config — these are NOT "nice to have". Either the value is in the DB or the system is misconfigured.
- NEVER mix real config data with fake fallback defaults (`|| "ACME"`, `|| "x-gateway-secret"`). A fake config that looks valid but points to the wrong IDP is worse than a clear error.
- Mandatory fields: validate in a check block before the return, throw if missing. Optional fields: stay `undefined` if missing.

## Enforcement
- AI agent MUST use `snake_case` for all new TS interfaces, types, entity fields, JSON response fields.
- AI agent MUST NOT create DTO classes/interfaces that rename fields between DB and TS models.
- AI agent MUST NOT add lowercasing/uppercasing/trimming on the read path — only at the write/upsert path.
- AI agent MUST NOT add fallback string-literal defaults (`|| "..."`, `?? ""`) for configuration data.
- AI agent MUST spread raw DB results (`...settings`) instead of field-by-field rebuilding, unless a field needs a real type conversion.
- When reviewing existing code, flag any camelCase field names in entity-shaped JSON responses as violations.
