# GitFlow Rules - Primebrick Microservices

This repository follows GitFlow. AI agents MUST follow these rules.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER COMMIT AUTOMATICALLY

**AI agents MUST NEVER commit changes without explicit user instruction.**

- **WAIT for the user to explicitly tell you to commit** before running any `git commit` command
- This applies to ALL situations - no exceptions
- The user must explicitly say "commit", "procedi con il commit", or equivalent
- Do NOT commit even if you think the work is complete
- Do NOT commit even if you think it's "obvious"
- **ALWAYS wait for explicit user instruction before committing**

## Branch Creation Rules

- **NEVER work directly on `develop` or `main`** - always create feature branches first
- **Feature branches**: `git checkout -b feature/<slug>` from updated `develop`
- **Release branches**: `git checkout -b release/<version>` from `develop` (for version bumps)
- **Hotfix branches**: `git checkout -b hotfix/<version>` from `main` (for production fixes)

## When to ask user permission

- **ASK before creating NEW feature branch** if another feature branch is already open
- **DO NOT ask permission** to commit changes on existing feature branch
- **DO NOT ask permission** to close a feature branch (follow proper closing procedure)

## Branch Closing Procedure (MANDATORY)

When closing ANY branch (`feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`):

1. **Merge to appropriate base branch**:
   - Feature: `git merge --no-ff feature/<branch>` into `develop`
   - Release: `git merge --no-ff release/<version>` into `main`
   - Hotfix: `git merge --no-ff hotfix/<version>` into `main`

2. **Push the merged base branch**: `git push origin <base-branch>`

3. **Delete branch LOCALLY**: `git branch -d <branch-name>`

4. **Delete branch on ORIGIN**: `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`

5. **For Release/Hotfix**: Also merge `main` back to `develop` to stay aligned

## CRITICAL: Package.json Update Before Closing Release/Hotfix

**BEFORE** merging a release or hotfix branch to main, you MUST:

1. Update the version in `package.json` to match the release/hotfix version
2. Commit the package.json change on the release/hotfix branch
3. THEN merge to main (the package.json change will be included in the merge)
4. This ensures the version file is committed before the merge/rebase with main and develop

**Correct flow for release:**
1. Create release branch from develop
2. Update package.json version on release branch
3. Commit package.json change
4. Merge release to main (includes package.json change)
5. Tag main
6. Push main with tags
7. Merge main back to develop
8. Push develop
9. Delete release branch

## Version Tagging Rules

- **NO 'v' prefix** in branch names: `release/0.13.2` (not `release/v0.13.2`)
- **NO 'v' prefix** in tags for FE/BE: `0.13.2` (not `v0.13.2`)
- **Tag derived from branch name**: `release/0.13.2` → tag `0.13.2`
- **Hotfix increments PATCH**: `0.13.1` → `hotfix/0.13.2` → tag `0.13.2`
- **Release increments MINOR**: `0.13.2` → `release/0.14.0` → tag `0.14.0`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Committing directly on `develop` or `main`
- ❌ Creating commits before creating feature branch
- ❌ Forgetting to delete branches (both local and origin)
- ❌ Using 'v' prefix in tags
- ❌ Not pushing merged base branch
- ❌ Leaving feature branches open after merge

## Repository-Specific Rules

- When working from meta-workspace root, use `cd microservices && git <command>`

## Commit rules

- NEVER commit automatically - wait for explicit user instruction
- DO NOT ask user to approve commit messages
- Write appropriate commit messages directly when instructed
- DO NOT open editor for commit approval

## Commit and Push Guidelines

When instructed to "commit and push everything" or similar commands:
- Run `git add -A` in ALL repositories in the workspace
- Commit ALL staged files in each repository
- Push ALL branches to origin
- Do NOT filter files by task relevance - commit everything that has changed
- This applies to multi-repository workspaces: commit changes in frontend, backend, and microservices repositories

## New task workflow

When the user starts a fresh piece of work with phrases such as "Let's start a new task", "Iniziamo un nuovo task", or equivalent:

1. Infer a branch slug from context — lowercase, kebab-case, ASCII letters/digits/hyphens only
2. Before the first tracked-file change, ensure a branch `feature/<slug>` exists from up-to-date `develop`
3. State the slug once (e.g. "Branch: `feature/iana-timezone`") so the user can rename if needed
4. After creating a feature branch, verify with `git branch --show-current` so the working tree matches the branch
